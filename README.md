# hello-world

Hi there!

I am in the process of self-teaching myself how to use GitHub.  I am an administrative professional with a love for learning and all things tech.  The changes I've made to this file just include the brief blurb about myself.

I plan on adding this skill to my upwork profile as a new skill.  So far so good.
